# Integrated Customer Analytics Framework for Business Optimization

## Objective
The project aims to leverage advanced data mining techniques and analytics methodologies to enhance business decision-making and optimize customer-centric strategies. Focus areas include Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), ABC analysis, Cohort Analysis, Association Rule mining, and Time Series forecasting using LSTM and ARIMA models. Various methods such as recursive, direct, and multiple output approaches will be explored.

## Components

1. **Data Mining:**
   - Extract valuable insights from large datasets.
   - Identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):**
   - Calculate and analyze CLTV.
   - Segment customers based on their lifetime value.

3. **ABC Analysis:**
   - Classify products or customers into categories (A, B, and C) based on significance.
   - Optimize resource allocation and prioritize efforts.

4. **Cohort Analysis:**
   - Track the behavior of specific customer groups over time.
   - Identify trends and make targeted improvements in customer retention.

5. **Association Rule Mining:**
   - Discover hidden associations and relationships among variables.
   - Extract meaningful rules for cross-selling and upselling strategies.

6. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - Implement LSTM and ARIMA models for predicting future trends.
   - Evaluate accuracy and adjust strategies based on model performance.

7. **Methods:**
   - Explore recursive approaches for iterative refinement.
   - Investigate direct methods for one-step-ahead forecasting.
   - Implement multiple output models for simultaneous prediction.

## Expected Outcomes
   - Improved customer segmentation and targeting.
   - Enhanced resource allocation through ABC analysis.
   - Informed decision-making through accurate time series forecasting.
   - Refined strategies for customer retention and satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies
   - Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, statsmodels)
   - Data visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn)
   - Database systems for data storage and retrieval.

## Deliverables
   - Comprehensive analysis reports with findings and recommendations.
   - Implementable models and algorithms for ongoing business optimization.
   - Visualizations and dashboards for effective communication of insights.
